This repository contains a shell script demonstrating a subtle bug related to directory processing using `find` and a `while` loop. The bug is triggered when the target directory is empty or contains only hidden files. The `bug.sh` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.sh` provides a corrected version.  The core issue lies in how the loop handles an empty input stream from `find`.  The solution demonstrates a more robust approach to handling such cases.
